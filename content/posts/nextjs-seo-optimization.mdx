SEO, and specifically the on-page SEO we'll be looking at today, is about optimizing the content within your site,
such as proper keyword usage, title structure, meta tags, site speed, and accessibility.

## Leverage Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in Next.js is a technique where web pages are generated and rendered directly
on the server, rather than on the client side. This means that when a user requests a page, the server dynamically
generates the HTML content and sends it ready-made to the browser, rather than just sending JavaScript code that
the browser must execute to generate the content.

```jsx
export default function Home() {
    const res = await fetch(`${URL}/resources`);
    const data = await res.json();
  return <h1>{data[0].title}</h1>
} 
```

## Optimize Meta Tags and Titles
Meta tags and titles play a vital role in SEO, influencing how your pages are displayed in search results.
Next.js's Head component allows you to dynamically set these tags per page, improving relevancy and click-through rates.

```jsx
import Head from 'next/head';
function HomePage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>Your Page Title</title>
        <meta name="description" content="A brief description of your page" />
      </Head>
      {/* Page content */}
    </>
  );
} 
```

## Image optimization
Use Next.js's image-optimized component to reduce loading times 
without sacrificing image quality, which has a positive impact on SEO.
Remember to use alt!!

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image';
function HomePage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Image src="your-image.webp" alt="logo image" width={50} height={50} />
    </>
  );
} 
```

## Correct use of HTML tags
Properly organize your heading tags (H1, H2, H3, etc.) to improve page structure and make it easier for search engines to crawl.

## Meta tag e metadata optimization
Add appropriate meta tags, including those for the title and description, as well as generate additional metadata to improve display in search results and on social media.

```jsx
import type { Metadata } from "next";
import "./globals.css";

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Blog SEO",
  description: "Generated by create next app",
  other: {
    "theme-colo": "#od1117",
    "color-scheme": "dark-only",
  },
};

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className="min-h-screen bg-black-100 font-poppins">{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Technologies used
These are the technologies I used for this website.

- **Next.js:** A React framework for building JavaScript applications.
- **Sanity.io:** A platform for structured content that comes with an open-source editing environment called Sanity Studio.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional types.
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **CSS:** A stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML.
- **JSON:** A lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.
- **@sanity/image-url:** A library for generating image URLs with Sanity.io.
- **next-sanity:** A library that provides utilities for working with Sanity.io in Next.js applications.
- **clsx:** A tiny utility for constructing className strings conditionally.
- **tailwind-merge:** A utility for merging Tailwind CSS classes.
- **query-string:** A library for parsing and stringifying URL query strings.

## How to use Nexjs
To use NextJs, you need to create a new NextJs project by running the following
command:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-app
```

This will create a new NextJs project in a directory called `my-app`. You can
then navigate to the project directory and start the development server by
running the following command:

```bash
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and open your NextJs application in your
browser. You can then start building your application by creating new pages,
components, and API routes.

## Conclusion

NextJs is a powerful React framework that makes it easy to build server-rendered
React applications. This post has introduced you to the basics of SEO on-page and
explained how you want to use it in your projects.
