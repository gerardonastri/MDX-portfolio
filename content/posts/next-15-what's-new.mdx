# What's New in Next.js 15

Next.js 15 has brought a fresh wave of features, optimizations, and refinements that further solidify its position as a premier framework for React applications. From better edge caching to enhanced developer experience, let’s dive into the top changes in this latest release.

## Full Support of React 19 with New Hooks in Next.js 15

Next.js 15 fully supports React 19, enabling the use of powerful new hooks to enhance functionality and state management in applications. Let’s explore some of the standout hooks:

## `useActionState`: Manage Ongoing Actions in UI

`useActionState` is a new hook for managing and displaying ongoing action states in the UI.

```jsx
// ActionStateComponent.js
const submitActionWithCurrentState = async (prevState, formData) => {
  // Simulate adding user data
};

export default function ActionStateComponent() {
  const [state, formAction] = useActionState(submitActionWithCurrentState, {
    users: [],
    error: null,
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>useActionState Example</h1>
      <form action={formAction} id="action-hook-form">
        <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Enter your name" />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
      <div>{state?.error}</div>
      {state?.users?.map((user) => (
        <div key={user.username}>Name: {user.username} Age: {user.age}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Updated Caching Strategies
In response to developer feedback, Next.js 15 refines caching strategies to make data fetching more predictable.

No More Automatic Caching: Fetch requests and route handlers no longer cache by default; use ```{ cache: 'force-cache' }``` to cache explicitly.
```jsx
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.dimeloper.com/', { cache: 'force-cache' });
  return res.json();
}
```
Client Router Caching Adjustments: Page components aren't cached by default, ensuring up-to-date data for in-app navigation.
To retain original caching behavior, configure the staleTime in next.config.js:

```jsx
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    staleTimes: {
      dynamic: 30, // Dynamic route cache for 30 seconds
      static: 180, // Static route cache for 180 seconds
    },
  },
};
```

## Asynchronous Request-Specific APIs
Next.js 15 now supports asynchronous request-specific APIs such as headers, cookies, params, and searchParams, providing a smoother data handling experience.

```jsx
// search/page.tsx

export default async function SearchPage({ searchParams }) {
  const params = await searchParams;
  const query = params.query;

  return <div>Results for: {query}</div>;
}
```

## Introducing the New Form Component
Next.js 15 adds the Form component, which brings prefetching, client-side navigation, and progressive enhancement to forms. This component improves speed and efficiency for form-heavy applications.

```jsx
// FormPage.js

import { Form } from 'next/form';

export default function FormPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Next v15 Form Component</h1>
      <Form action="/search">
        <input name="query" placeholder="Enter search query" />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </Form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## TurboPack: Accelerated Development
With TurboPack, developers experience faster local server startups and code refreshes. Activate it with next dev --turbo for speed gains up to 75% for server startup and 95% for code updates.

```json
// package.json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev --turbo"
}
```

## ESLint 9 Support
Next.js 15 brings ESLint 9 support, ensuring enhanced React hook support and improved code quality, with backward compatibility for ESLint 8 users.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, Next.js 15 brings a host of powerful updates, making it one of the most versatile and efficient frameworks for modern web development. With full support for React 19, enhanced caching options, a streamlined form component, and TurboPack for accelerated development, this release optimizes both user experience and developer productivity. The improvements to asynchronous APIs and native TypeScript support further solidify Next.js as a top choice for developers looking to build scalable, high-performance applications. Whether you're upgrading an existing project or starting fresh, Next.js 15 offers the tools needed to push your applications to the next level.
